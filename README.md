## About
Joblicant is a dashboard interface showcasing all your job applications in one place! The dashboard is dynamically updated by each action the user takes from creating, editing, and deleting applications. This results in the updating of a dynamic calendar which displays all your applications in a scheduled format to keep you organized with certain applications and their status (Interviews, results, etc.) Users can also save commonly used application information and easily copy/paste that over to whatever they're applying for.

## How it started
As a college student looking to step in the internship/work world of software engineering, I needed to keep track of all my applications and be populated in not just in text, but visually through a calendar without any secondary action from you. I also grew passionate to expand my skillset towards more backend and database tech stacks such as python/django and sqlite which both fit perfectly with this project I had in mind.

## Features
With Joblicant, users can create an application where they are asked to insert the job title, company name, date applied, status, interview date, and result. Not all of these applications are required, but can soon be edited later on which the user has access to, simply by clicking on the application or user actions button and clicking "edit". Users can also easily delete applications with a simple click of a button. By creating, editing, and deleting the application, it automatically populates or edits out the calendar feature Joblicant offers which gives the user a visual outlook of all their applications in a scheduled manner.

## Future Steps
Some future steps I want to take to improve Joblicant would be to add some scoring, or coin-earning system for each application that is applied or resulted in a success. I also want to easily link outer application sites which eases the application process all intern prospects do. With a simple click of a certain job posting, all of the required fields will be populated by Joblicant. This would possibly extend towards the form of a chrome extension which can be activated when on a job posting application. I also need to implement user authentication to allow users to securely store their applications. Finally, I would want to implement customizable views where users can have both the dashboard and calendar in one viewpoint, or customize it in their own way.

## Conclusion
Even though Joblicant was a short project for me, I still found it very effective in my software engineer development and found it to be very enjoyable as I got to try out new technologies I haven't tried yet. It allowed me to gradually expand my skillset towards more of the backend and databases, as I gradually ease my way towards becoming a proficient full-stack developer. I hope to come back to this project and finish the future features I want to implement!
